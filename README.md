# Personality-Prediction

Personality prediction plays a major role in defining a candidate, his attitude, and his approach towards managing things and responding to them. Machine learning is the use and development of computer systems that can learn and adapt without following explicit instructions, by using algorithms and statistical models to analyze and draw inferences from patterns in data which is a subdivision of Artificial intelligence that helps predict the personalities of the candidates.  

# The major objectives of this project are as follows: 
1)To make the machine more human and analyze the candidate in such a way that     an actual human reviewer would do. 
2)To develop a system and provide a more effective way of short-listing the       candidates. 
3)To automate the process of requirement specifications and applicant ranking. 

# Python Modules/Libraries:  

1. OS : For accessing files and data from internal storage.  

2. Pandas : For accessing and manipulating datasheets.  

3. NumPy : For working on arrays and other data manipulation.  

4. Tkinter : For building the GUI.  

5. Functools : Tools for Manipulating Functions. Purpose: Functions that operate on other functions. 6. Pyresparser : Module for extracting information from the resume.  

7. Sklearn : It features various classification, regression, and clustering algorithms. We used sklearn to make the model learn on various characteristic values using logical regression. 

# Algorithms
The algorithm used for this study uses a person's gender, age, openness, conscientiousness, extraversion, agreeableness, neuroticism, and experience scores to predict their personality. On the result page, it displays all the information from the entered data and uploaded resume after parsing all the CV/resume data. 

In this system, the model is trained using logistic regression, and the information from the resume is parsed using the pyresparser module, which was created using the nltk and spaCy modules in Python.
